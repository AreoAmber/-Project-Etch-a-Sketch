Step one:
> Create a page with a grid of 16x16 squares
> Create these divs dynamically with JS
> Put grid squares in a main-div-container
> Use flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid. Use flexbox

how do i create a grid of 16x16 suares?
need to use JS for this...
will need to use the createElement to create a div inside the main-div-container so the 16x16 can be created.

what i did was write a for loop that starts condition from  0 and loops all the way through to 256
(Got the 256 by multiplying 16x16 since sqaures are supposed to be 16x16). On each loop an new sqaure is appended
hence creating identical square blocks.

In my CSS i used  the box sizing function that tells the browser to include the border of the width and height.
Used flex-wrap so my squares don't overlap and create a classing grid of squares.


Step 2: Hovering effect

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, 
leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.


according to chatgpt i need to use the addEventListgeners and apply it to div which will affect individual squares.
 after adding it to my div what i can do next is append to the divContainer using the child
